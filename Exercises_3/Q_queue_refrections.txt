Reflection: Why FIFO Supports Fairness in Government Services

Order of Arrival = Order of Service
   I- n your RRA example, citizens arrive one by one.

   - FIFO ensures that Citizen1, who came first, is served before Citizen2, and so on.

   - This prevents later arrivals from skipping ahead, which maintains fairness.

Transparency and Trust
   - At the BK ATM, everyone sees the queue.

   - Knowing that the first to join will be the first to finish builds trust in the system.

   - People don’t need special connections or privileges to be served on time.

Efficiency in Resource Distribution
   - In your ID distribution demo, using a queue gives IDs in order (ID1 → ID2 → ID3…).

   - This ensures citizens get resources sequentially and equally, without confusion or disputes.

Contrast with Stack (LIFO)
   - If IDs were distributed with a stack, the last person to join gets served first.

   - This is unfair in public services because it rewards latecomers over those who waited.
