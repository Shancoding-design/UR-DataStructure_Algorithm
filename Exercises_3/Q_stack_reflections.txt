UR Quizzes Stack
Quizzes are pushed one by one. Undo removes the last quiz entered.
- Shows how undo/back works using LIFO (Last-In-First-Out).

Irembo Steps Stack
Steps are pushed as you move forward in a form. Popping removes steps in reverse until the stack is empty.
- Explains multi-step navigation and backtracking in forms.

Challenges Stack
Items are pushed, popped, then updated again (e.g., push 1,2,3 -> pop two -> push 4).
- Demonstrates dynamic correction, updates, and viewing the current focus (top).

Overall Reflection:
 -Stacks are powerful for undo/redo, backtracking, navigation, and correcting mistakes because they always remove the most recent action first.
